As I grew up, I always loved witnessing the end product of my projects, which included my efforts with front and back end, and I felt nothing but joy. I will work with my peers and create a positive environment by being compatible and ensuring that there is no confusion! Previously, as an insurance agent, I have habits of taking the initiative and making sure that we are making progress to promote time management. Most importantly, my mindset is always on a growth mindset and open to critique while providing feedback.</h3> */}
